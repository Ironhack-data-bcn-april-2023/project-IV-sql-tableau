## Project Description

As a consulting firm,  we will analyze the current state of the sales of a retail chain across multiple sites, products and months. The goal is to provide valuable insights in order to make crucial business decisions. The company is going through a bad financial situation and needs to cut costs somehow. They have asked us to make some decisive decisions for the company to move forward.

## Dataset

The "Sales Data for Economic Data Analysis" dataset was retrieved from Kaggle. A comprehensive view of sales transactions.
- The dataset contains information about sales transactions, including details such as the customer's age, gender, location, and the products sold.
- The dataset includes data on both the cost of the product and the revenue generated from its sale, allowing for calculations of profit and profit margins.


## Metrics to analyze:

- profit and profit margins from the cost of the product and the revenue generated from its sale.
- volume of products sold, which could be used to analyze sales trends over time.
- purchasing behavior across different demographic groups
- Segmentation (M/F) and age.
- Real-time KPI tracking dashboard to analyze company performance.

## Tech Stack
